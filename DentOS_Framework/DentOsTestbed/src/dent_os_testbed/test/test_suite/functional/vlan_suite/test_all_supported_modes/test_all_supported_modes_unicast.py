    Test Name: Unicast with all modes supported
    Test Suite: suite_functional_vlan
    Test Overview: Test VLAN with unicast when all modes supported
    Test Procedure:
    1.Specify test data: packet to send, port settings: vla id, tagged/untagged etc.
        Port 1 vlan 2 tagged, 3 untagged,4 pvid untagged
        Port 2 vlan 2 tagged
        Port 3 vlan 3 pvid untagged
        Port 4 vlan 4 pvid untagged

    2.Create bridge entity and set state to "up" state.
        Verify bridge entity created and is set to "up" state.

    3.Create links and set state to `up`.
        Verify links are created and put to "Ã¹p" state.

    4.Set bridge as master to links.
        Verify links enslaved to bridge

    5.Set links to vlans as specified in step #1.
        Verify vlans successfully added to links

    6. Map receiving and non receiving ports.
        Port 1 ->  tx_port
        Ports 4 -> rx_ports

    7. Setup packet stream(s) for the broadcast package:
        src_mac =
        dst_mac = ?

    8. Clean Traffic generators  stats before sending stream.

    9. Send traffic to rx_ports
        Verify:
         traffic with vlan "x" received on port 4
         traffic with vlan "1" received on port 2
         traffic with vlan "2" received on port 1, 2
         traffic with vlan "3" received on port 1, 3
         traffic with vlan "4" received on port 1, 4
