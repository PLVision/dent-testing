    Test Name: Multicast with default configuration
    Test Suite: suite_functional_vlan
    Test Overview: Test VLAN default configuration with multicast package
    Test Procedure:
    1.Specify test data: packet to send, port settings: vla id, tagged/untagged etc.
        Port 1 vlan 1 pvid untagged
        Port 2 vlan 1 pvid untagged
        Port 3 vlan 1 pvid untagged
        Port 4 vlan 1 pvid untagged

    2.Create bridge entity and set state to "up" state.
        Verify bridge entity created and is set to "up" state.

    3.Create links and set state to `up`.
        Verify links are created and put to "Ã¹p" state.

    4.Set bridge as master to links.
        Verify links enslaved to bridge

    5.Set links to vlans as specified in step #1.
        Verify vlans successfully added to links

    6. Map receiving and non receiving ports. Who sends and who not.
        Link 1 ->  tx_port
        Links 2-4 -> rx_ports

    7. Setup packet stream for the broadcast package:
        src_mac = ?
        dst_mac = "01:00:5E:00:00:C8"

    8. Clean Traffic generators  stats before sending stream.

    9. Send traffic to rx_ports
        Verify traffic received on ports #2 ,3, 4  with no VID in packet
